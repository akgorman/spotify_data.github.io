## Project Information
</div>

Our project aims to explore the association between popularity of songs and qualities of those songs that can be quantified. As active Spotify users, our team members were motivated to build our understanding of whether measurable qualities such as danceability, valence, or bpm are associated with popularity. We also dug into the alignment between several streaming and social media sites, with the assumption that apps such as Tik Tok are a driving force behind song popularity.

Overall, our project goal was to provide context for why songs and artists become and maintain popularity. We aimed to perform exploratory analysis on our original motivating questions, as well as any secondary questions that arose throughout the project.

## Project Data
</div>

To perform our analyses, we explored two datasets from Kaggle inclusive of Spotify's most stream songs  by year for 2023 and 2024. Given the data available, we performed different analyses per year. We also created a combined dataset and performed cross-year analyses, where available and appropriate. A detailed codebook can be found [here](about.html), and a discussion of raw data is included within the relevant exploratory analysis pages.

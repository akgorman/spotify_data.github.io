<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Decoding Spotify Music Trends</h1>

</div>


<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The initial motivation for the project was to expand the
understanding of why songs and artists trend on music streaming
platforms, such as Spotify. Quality of music is certainly subjective,
however it is interesting to consider whether measurable qualities such
as danceability, valence, or beats per minute are associated with
popularity. As a step further, we were motivated to examine whether
these relationships between measurable quantities and popularities
remained consistent throughout the calendar year or rather ebbed and
flowed as the seasons changed.</p>
<p>We were also curious about the consistency and interaction between
various streaming and social media platforms. With the rapid rise of the
social media site tik tok and continued usage of platforms such as
Youtube and SoundCloud, we looked to examine whether popularity on one
site might correlate to another, or alternatively if the sites appealed
to user bases with different music preferences.</p>
<p>Overall, our project goal was to provide context for why songs and
artists become and maintain popularity. We aimed to perform exploratory
analysis on our original motivating questions, as well as any secondary
questions that arose throughout the project.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>We found a few sources of inspiration for this project, the first
being Spotify Wrapped. Each year, Spotify provides users with a summary
of their most listened to songs, artists, genres, etc., giving insight
into their preferences. While we each have different music preferences,
we thought it interesting to consider whether some qualities of music
were universally appealing.</p>
<p>While beginning our research, we found other projects in this space
that served as further inspiration, including a capstone project
completed by students at Carnegie Mellon University titled “<a
href="https://amt-lab.org/blog/2019/9/a-competitive-analysis-of-the-music-streaming-industry">Competitive
Analysis of the Music Streaming Industry</a>”. This project considered
trends and the competitive aspects of the music streaming market, and
included consideration of various streaming and social media platforms.
This project was influential as we decided to include interaction
between various streaming platforms as part of our analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>In the 2023 dataset, we were interested in exploring song popularity
on Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and Shazam to determine if top songs
were consistent across different music streaming platforms. We also
wanted to know how various song characteristics such as BPM, key, mode,
danceability, etc. differed across top songs to find out what makes a
hit track.</p>
<p>In the 2024 dataset, we were interested in seeing if song popularity
differed across various streaming platforms (e.g., Spotify, Soundcloud,
YouTube, TikTok, Apple Music, etc.) as well as if different artists were
more popular on certain platforms. As we began to analyze and parse
through the data, we also were interested in whether a track being
explicit or not would affect its popularity or number of streams. We
also wanted to specifically see if TikTok engagement (e.g., TikTok
likes, views, posts) was related to the number of streams across various
platforms.</p>
<p>By combining the 2023 and 2024 datasets, we hoped to assess overlap
in top songs and evaluate common characteristics of top songs, where
applicable. We also were interested in seeing if specific track
characteristics (e.g., danceability) were associated with greater
popularity (e.g., TikTok engagement).</p>

<p>The spotify-2023.csv dataset contains information about the most
streamed songs on Spotify in 2023. Each observation includes basic
information such as track name, artist, and release date, as well as
streaming data on various platforms including Spotify, Apple Music,
Deezer, and Shazam. Popularity is measured through total streams,
presence on playlists, and presence on charts. Additionally, BPM, key,
mode, and other music characteristics like danceability, energy, and
liveness were included for each of the top tracks.</p>
<p>The 2023 dataset was already fairly clean to begin with, but a few
changes were made for clarity and consistency. Variable names were
simplified and only one stream observation had to be set as “NA” due to
the presence of an uninterpretable character variable rather than a
numeric value. There were no duplicates in this dataset.</p>

<p>The 2024_data.csv dataset contains information about the most
streamed songs on Spotify in 2024. Each track includes general basic
information like the track name, artist name, and album name as well as
extensive information on its reach across several streaming platforms
(including Spotify, SoundCloud, Youtube, TikTok, Apple Music, etc. ).
Popularity is measured across these different platforms through
variables such as all time rank, number of streams, playlist reach, and
playlist count.</p>
<p>Some issues that came up while cleaning the data was with values
having unsupported characters (e.g., in the album_name column) and that
did not allow for analysis for the all time rank analysis. Another issue
that we filtered out was that two tracks had a duplicate observation,
but the duplicate observations did not have any streaming information
and both had “xSyborg” listed as the artist name. The
<code>tidal_popularity</code> variable was removed because the entire
column had no observations.</p>

<p>Prior to merging the aforementioned datasets, in the 2023 dataset, we
renamed <code>track_name</code> to <code>track</code>,
<code>streams</code> to <code>2023_spotify_streams</code>,
<code>in_spotify_playlists</code> to
<code>2023_spotify_playlist_count</code>,
<code>in_apple_playlists</code> to
<code>2023_apple_music_playlist_count</code>,
and<code>in_deezer_playlists</code> to
<code>2023_deezer_playlist_count</code>. In the 2024 dataset, we
separated <code>release_date</code> into <code>released_year</code>,
<code>released_month</code>, <code>released_day</code>, changed
<code>spotify_streams</code> to <code>2024_spotify_streams</code>,
<code>spotify_playlist_count</code> to
<code>2024_spotify_playlist_count</code>,
<code>apple_music_playlist_count</code> to
<code>2024_apple_music_playlist_count</code>, and
<code>deezer_playlist_count</code> to
<code>2024_deezer_playlist_count</code>. Variables that were removed
from the 2023 dataset prior to merging include the following:
<code>artist_count</code>, <code>in_spotify_charts</code>,
<code>in_apple_charts</code>, <code>in_deezer_charts</code>,
<code>in_shazam_charts</code>, and <code>instrumentalness</code>.
Variables that were removed from the 2024 dataset prior to merging
include the following: <code>album_name</code>, <code>isrc</code>,
<code>all_time_rank</code>, <code>track_score</code>,
<code>spotify_playlist_reach</code>, <code>spotify_popularity</code>,
<code>you_tube_views</code>, <code>you_tube_likes</code>,
<code>air_play_spins</code>, <code>sirius_xm_spins</code>,
<code>deezer_playlist_reach</code>, <code>amazon_playlist_count</code>,
<code>pandora_streams</code>, and
<code>pandora_track_stations</code>.</p>
<p>Datasets were merged based on <code>track</code>,
<code>released_year</code>, <code>released_month</code>, and
<code>released_day</code>. The <code>artist</code> variable for the 2023
was kept because the 2023 dataset includes the artists that are featured
on the track as well.</p>
<p>When merging the datasets (through inner_join), we found that there
were 17 duplicate songs where the duplicate observations contained
information for both 2023 and 2024 Spotify streams, Spotify playlist
count, and Apple Music playlist count. Some duplicates, however, have
varying missing information about 2024 Deezer playlist count and/or
TikTok data. Some other notable discrepancies we found among the 17
tracks were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daylight and Numb are duplicate track names but are from different
artists</li>
<li>My Universe has limited information in both duplicates</li>
<li>SNAP has two duplicates (4 total)</li>
<li>SPIT IN MY FACE is a duplicate but they are in different keys/have
different song details (e.g., danceability, valence, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<div id="exploratory-analysis-1" class="section level4">
<h4>2023 Exploratory Analysis</h4>
<p>In order to get a better idea of what listeners gravitated towards on
Spotify in 2023, we wanted to analyze the year’s top streamed songs.</p>
<p>When looking at keys and modes, we found that listeners favored C
major, G major, G keys, and major over minor mode. D major was found to
be the least popular key that year, and the minor mode was streamed 33%
less than the major mode. When analyzing tempo trends, we found that
listeners most enjoyed the range 90-120 BPM, with other values having
slight peaks such as 140, 150, and 170 BPM. Songs that ranked relatively
high on the danceability and energy scale were clustered together,
indicating a preference towards high intensity anthems. Danceability and
energy were compared on a density plot, with the two values lining up
almost exactly. This can indicate that danceability and energy are
likely similar variables.</p>
<p>We then looked into the world of sound, analyzing liveness compared
to speechiness to uncover if listeners preferred live music and songs
with a high percentage of words. We found that most people enjoyed a
relatively low value for both, with clusters falling primarily between
0-25 for liveness and 0-60 for speechiness. A pie chart was created to
compare instrumental (9.13%) and vocal (90.9%) songs, with vocal songs
being the primary type of top streamed song.</p>
<p>Top ten charts were created in order to get a better idea of what
songs and artists were the most popular across the year for different
variables. Artists such as Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, The Weekend, and
Drake made multiple appearances across various charts, indicating
popularity and large fan bases. The K-Pop band BTS had multiple features
and one of their band members created the track featured in the most
Spotify charts. When looking at the top ten songs in the most playlist
across Spotify for the year, we see that these songs range across
various years, allowing insight for what songs have stayed with
listeners despite new releases.</p>
<p>The Spotify Wrapped feature of 2023 introduced 12 unique listening
personalities based on users’ Spotify habits. Based on our analysis of
the top streamed songs, 2023’s collective musical personality would
align with The Luminary. This character is defined by a preference for
light, upbeat music. Songs that dominated the charts and playlists were
reflective of luminary traits, resonating with listeners who were
looking for uplifting, energizing tunes throughout the year!</p>

<h4>2024 Exploratory Analysis</h4>
<p>For our exploratory analysis of the 2024 Spotify dataset , we wanted
to look more into how track popularity changed across streaming
platforms, as well as if the genres of the top songs differed across
platforms. The exploratory analysis consisted of four major parts:
summary statistics and data (e.g., mean/median/IQR of streams across
platforms, percentage of explicit songs, etc.), top 10 artists by
different media platforms, top songs on streaming apps (e.g., Spotify
and Soundcloud), and top songs on socials (e.g., TikTok and
YouTube).</p>

<h4>Cross-Year Exploratory Analysis</h4>
<p>For our exploratory analysis of the merged 2023/2024 Spotify data, we
wanted to look more into how track popularity (e.g., TikTok streams) was
related to track characteristics (e.g., danceability). The exploratory
analysis consisted of four major parts: summary data, summary of musical
attributes (e.g., distribution of song count by BPM, distribution of
song count by danceability, etc.), musical attributes compared to
streaming data (e.g, distribution of Spotify streams by danceability),
and musical attributes compared to TikTok data (e.g, distribution of
TikTok engagement by danceability).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="additional-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional Analysis</h2>
<p>Using the 2023 and 2024 merged data, we conducted a linear regression
assessing the relationship between TikTok engagement and qualitative
features of the song such as danceability, energy, and liveness. All
variables were treated as numerical for this analysis. The level of
significance was set at 5%. Based on the linear regression assessing the
relationship between TikTok engagement and qualitative features of the
song such as danceability, energy, and liveness, none of the variables
had a statistically significant association with TikTok engagement.
However, one interesting insight was that danceability had a positive
association with TikTok engagement although it was not statistically
significant. This regression was driven by the hypothesis that livelier
and energetic music will have more TikTok engagement considering the
popularity of TikTok dance challenges. Although the findings were not
statistically significant, they were interesting.</p>

<div id="discussion-1" class="section level4">
<h4>2023 Discussion</h4>
<p><em>Tuning Into Music: A Journey Through Keys and Modes</em></p>
<p>The exploration of musical keys and modes offers valuable insights
into the tonal character of songs that resonated the most with listeners
in 2023. Through the distribution of Spotify streams and the count of
songs in different musical keys and modes, we can understand how certain
tonalities have shaped listening trends such as what is popular in
2023.</p>
<p>The distribution of streams by key shows the preferences by listeners
throughout the year. Certain keys such as C major and G major typically
dominate the charts, which explains their widespread use in mainstream
music. These keys have an open and bright sound, which appeals to both
artists and listeners. These popular keys indicate their role in evoking
feelings such as energetic uplighting. Another popular key to be
streamed is G. Music in this key can create a feeling of peace,
calmness, and satisfaction.</p>
<p>When looking at total streams by musical mode, the distribution of
mode provides insight to the overall character of music. Major modes are
typically associated with positive, bright emotions. Minor modes are
deeper, introspective sounds that may appeal to a smaller range of
listeners. In the graph, major has approximately 300,000,000,000 total
streams, while minor has close to 200,000,000 total streams. When
looking at popular songs for the year, the shift in major vs. minor
songs can reveal which emotional state resonated with listeners.</p>
<p><em>Tempo trends: Fast or Slow Beats?</em></p>
<p>Factors such as energy, tempo, and danceability play a crucial role
in how listeners connect with music. The interplay between these
characteristics can transform a song to feel relaxing, groovy, or
introspective. A deep dive into how tempo(BPM), danceability, and energy
can shape listener experience through the top tracks of 2023.</p>
<p>The tempo distribution shows that most streams fall in the moderate
range between approximately 90-120 BPM. This allows for a balance of
upbeat and relaxed tempos, suitable for a wide range of moods and
genres. There are other spikes around 140, 150, and 170 BPM, indicating
that there is an appeal for energetic tracks for parties, workouts, and
other high energy moments. Slower temps around 80 BPM are typically
calming, introspective songs. This wide variation of BPMs showcases that
listeners will interact with various tempos depending on activities and
emotions.</p>
<p>The relationship between danceability and energy highlights how songs
can balance groove and intensity. Tracks that have moderate energy
levels with high danceability often become popular. However, songs with
high energy and danceability are probably anthems used to cultivate
movement and excitement. Songs with lower energy but a high danceability
could reflect chill, laid back music like lo-fi or mellow R&amp;B.
Conversely, high energy and low danceability could indicate rock or
hip-hop. While there is no genre variable for this data, the clusters on
this chart may indicate different musical genres for the top songs of
2023.</p>
<p><em>The Multidimensional World of Sound</em></p>
<p>In this section we chose to focus on the balance between liveness,
speechiness, and the proportion of vocal and instrumental tracks.
Liveness refers to reverberation time, with a live room having a long
reverberation time. A higher liveness score indicates there is a higher
chance a song was recorded live. These may be live-recordings, acoustic
renditions, or unfiltered performances. Speechiness is the prominence of
spoken, with a higher value indicating more words spoken in a song.
Genres such as rap and spoken-word tracks will likely have higher
speechiness values. Most of the values cluster in the low liveness, low
speechiness level, mostly studio produced songs. Some songs have a high
liveness but have a lower speechiness, likely indicating melodies such
as acoustic sessions or crowd-filled songs.</p>
<p>Both vocal and instrumental songs made their way onto the top tracks
of 2023 list. Vocal tracks are those that dominate mainstream music
since a listener is able to hear a story and connection through vocal
delivery and lyrics. These tracks have the advantage of vocal and
instrumental aspects. Pop, R&amp;B, and hip-hop are typical genres that
have vocal tracks. Instrumental tracks on the other hand are often
genres such as classical, jazz, and lo-fi, all which lean heavily on
instrumentals to develop a sense of mood. This data showed a dominance
of vocal tracks at 90.9%. This is expected as vocal tracks are popular
in mainstream media, and therefore popular on streaming services such as
Spotify.</p>
<p><em>Data Wrapped: The Ultimate Chart-Toppers of 2023</em></p>
<p>The top ten artists with the most danceable songs included very
popular artists from 2023. These tracks are crowd-pleasers used for
various occasions such as working out, parties, and jam sessions. Taylor
Swift tops the chat with 25 songs, while BTS closed out the chart with
8. These artists reflect a few different styles of music such as pop,
Kpop, rap, country, and more. The top ten artists with the most songs in
2023 have the exact same group of ten people as the previous chart. It
is likely that artists that both release more music and have a large
level of popularity are more likely to be featured on this chart.</p>
<p>Next, we looked at the top ten tracks with the most appearances in
Spotify charts. Song success can be measured by charts, whether that be
global, regional, or genre related. Two songs were from the Barbie
movie, a popular film released in the summer of 2023. The top song,
Seven by Jungkook (feat. Latto), is an R&amp;B/soul, Korea Dance, K-pop
song. This variation of genres allows for the song to be featured in
multiple chart types. Typically songs featured in these charts become
cultural touchpoints, relating to widespread success and popularity.</p>
<p>The top ten most energetic songs can be defined as those with
intensity, activity, and overall drive. The most energetic song was a
Hip-Hop/Rap track called Murder on my Mind by YNW Melly. The next song
was I’m good(blue) which is a dance/electronic, pop song. While these
songs weren’t necessarily the top ten most streamed songs of the year,
their impact spans across years and even decades. The 5th and 9th songs
on the chart, Take on me and Everybody Wants to Rule the World were
released in 1985, making them the oldest songs on this list. These
songs’ continued presence in Spotify playlists speaks volumes about
their timeless appeal. On the other hand, Blinding Lights was the most
recently released song (2020), which has quickly climbed the charts to
the 6th most added song to Spotify playlists. This chart gives some
insight on which tracks capture a wide appeal, representing some of the
most iconic songs of all time.</p>

<div id="discussion-2" class="section level4">
<h4>2024 Discussion</h4>
<p>In the 2024 dataset, we found that the mean versus median streams or
views across all the platforms are very different from each other,
indicating that the distribution of data is skewed for each platform. It
is also interesting to note TikTok’s popularity, where the platform has
both the most mean and median views compared to the other platforms.
Spotify has the second greatest amount of mean and median streams for
2024. Additionally, we found that there is almost no overlap among the
most popular five songs streamed for Spotify, Soundcloud, YouTube, and
TikTok. Our analysis also allowed us to compare the popularity of
streaming platforms, where Tik Tok’s most viewed song has
233,232,311,463 views, and Soundcloud’s most streamed song has
319,835,943 streams. This factor of a hundred difference demonstrates
TikTok’s popularity compared to other streaming platforms such as
SoundCloud. It is also interesting that SoundCloud’s top streamed songs
are all in the hip hop/rap genre, where Spotify’s Top 5 streamed songs
generally fall into today’s hits/pop.</p>
<p>When looking at the graphs that compare Spotify streams, YouTube
views, Soundcloud streams, and Shazam counts, one can see that increased
Tik Tok likes (going from the Low to High category) is associated with
increased track streams or views. This makes sense that the more popular
songs on streaming platforms or songs that people want to know the name
of (through using Shazam) would also be popular on TikTok.</p>
<p>The top 10 artists with the most streams or views across Spotify,
Soundcloud, YouTube, and TikTok vary widely. Streaming platforms like
Spotify and TikTok (which have the highest number of user streams) have
top artists that more fall under the pop genre, while Soundcloud has
almost exclusively rap artists (with the exception of Major Lazer).</p>
</div>
<div id="cross-year-discussion" class="section level4">
<h4>Cross-Year Discussion</h4>
<p>When analyzing musical attributes (e.g., danceability, liveness, and
energy) and Spotify streams (both 2023 and 2024 combined), we found that
there appears to be no correlation between increasing Spotify streams
and increasing energy and danceability. Songs with both low and high
musical attributes (e.g., danceability and energy) have the highest
amount of Spotify streams. It appears that songs with lower liveness
have less Spotify streams, where the groups of songs with higher
liveness generally have higher streams.</p>
<p>When analyzing the TikTok engagement based on the distribution of
certain musical attributes, we found that there are some trends in
TikTok engagement based on specific attributes. For instance, the
highest TikTok engagement was associated with a danceability score of
71, an energy score of 68, and a liveness score of 3. These attributes
might be important for TikTok engagement including likes, and views.
They might have a predisposition to go viral.</p>
<p>Finally, the linear regression assessing the relationship between
TikTok engagement and qualitative features of the song such as
danceability, energy, and liveness found that none of the variables have
a statistically significant association with TikTok engagement. However,
one interesting insight is that danceability has a positive association
with TikTok engagement although it is not statistically significant.
This might corroborate the associations seen in the danceability plot,
which was the highest score with highest TikTok engagement from the
plots explored.</p>

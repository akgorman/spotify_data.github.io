# Exploratory Data Analysis
### Discussion of Raw Data

The spotify-2023.csv dataset contains information about the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023. Each observation includes basic information such as the track name, artist name, release date, and number of streams, as well as additional characteristics like bpm, key, mode, and other audio features. Popularity is measured by presence in Spotify playlists and charts, and across playlists and charts of other streaming platforms including Apple, Deezer, and Shazam.

```{r echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
spotify2023_df = 
  read_csv("data/spotify-2023.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename_with(~ gsub("_percent", "", .), contains("_percent")) |> 
  rename(artist = artist_s_name) |> 
  mutate(streams = ifelse(track_name == "Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)", NA, streams),
         streams = as.numeric(streams))

view(spotify2023_df)
```

### Summary Data

*Summary Statistics*

```{r}

    spotify_streams_median = median(streams, na.rm = TRUE),
    spotify_streams_iqr = IQR(streams, na.rm = TRUE),
    
    spotify_playlists_mean = mean(in_spotify_playlists, na.rm = TRUE),
    spotify_playlists_median = median(in_spotify_playlists, na.rm = TRUE),
    spotify_playlists_iqr = IQR(in_spotify_playlists, na.rm = TRUE),
    
    apple_playlists_mean = mean(in_apple_playlists, na.rm = TRUE),

      TRUE ~ Platform)
  ) |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = Statistic,               
    values_from = value
  )

  cols_label(

  tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_text(weight = "bold")
    ),
    locations = cells_column_labels()
  )

```
*Interpretation*
Total number of streams was only available for Spotify and displays a much greater mean than median, indicating a right-skewed distribution. The mean, median, and IQR for number of playlists each song was on are significantly larger for Spotify than Apple and Deezer. This suggests that the total number of playlists on Spotify is much larger than the total number of playlists on Apple or Deezer. The distributions of number of playlists for Spotify, Apple, and Deezer are also right-skewed.
